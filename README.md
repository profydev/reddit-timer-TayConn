This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project I have learned how to create a marketing webpage using React.js that would host a connection to a Reddit API to show users when the best time to post in any sub-reddit they choose for best visibility and audience.

To test my page layout capabilities and using basic react app tools such as routing, I have created a single page web app that hosts a placeholder for the content that would be delivered via API. 

I am taking a temporary break on this project and in the future - I would live to revisit this project to continue building this app to integrate the full features of the api.
